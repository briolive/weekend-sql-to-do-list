# SQL To-Do List

## Description

Welcome to my first SQL To-Do List! You can add new tasks through a form that are sent to the server and update the SQL database. Whenever a task is created, the front end will refresh to show all of the tasks in the table with a Complete and Delete button. When you click Complete, the task is updated in the database as completed, the task has a strike-through, and the Complete button is deactivated. You can delete a task at any time with the Delete button, which deletes it from the front-end as well as the database. I have a weakness for ruler-paper to-do lists, so you'll notice mine has a more old-school theme. Don't forget to drink water and be kind to yourself. :)
